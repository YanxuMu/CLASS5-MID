			<p><em><b>Soul</b></em> is a 2020 American computer-animated fantasy comedy-drama film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures.</p> 
				<p>The protagonist, Gardner is a middle school music teacher with nothing new in life, and his real dream is to play the piano-not just teaching children to play the piano as he does now but to make a living by making music and jazz. When he finally got his first job as a musician, he accidentally fell into the sewer and "dead", and woke up in a black hole, becoming a lonely soul. Soon, it found that it was not a "soul" alone, but had arrived at the YOU seminar. Another soul, nicknamed 22, has participated in the seminar for hundreds of years. It hates mankind extremely and has never been possessed. Soon, Gardner and 22 will return to the real world together. There, Gardner will regain his enthusiasm and intelligence, and learn what it means to truly "have a soul."</p>
